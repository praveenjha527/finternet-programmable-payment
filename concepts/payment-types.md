  -H "X-API-Key: sk_test_your_key" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "amount": "100.00",
    "currency": "USDC",
    "type": "DELIVERY_VS_PAYMENT",
    "settlementMethod": "OFF_RAMP_MOCK",
    "settlementDestination": "bank_account_123",
    "metadata": {
      "releaseType": "DELIVERY_PROOF",
      "autoRelease": true
    }
  }'

# Submit delivery proof
curl https://api.finternet.com/v1/payment-intents/intent_xxx/escrow/delivery-proof \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_test_your_key" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "proofHash": "0x...",
    "proofURI": "https://example.com/proof",
    "submittedBy": "0x..."
  }'
```

#### 2. Time-Based Release

Funds automatically released after a specified time:

```bash
curl https://api.finternet.com/v1/payment-intents \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_test_your_key" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "amount": "100.00",
    "currency": "USDC",
    "type": "DELIVERY_VS_PAYMENT",
    "settlementMethod": "OFF_RAMP_MOCK",
    "settlementDestination": "bank_account_123",
    "metadata": {
      "releaseType": "TIME_LOCKED",
      "timeLockUntil": "1735689600"
    }
  }'
```

#### 3. Milestone-Based Release

Funds released as project milestones are completed:

```bash
# Create milestone
curl https://api.finternet.com/v1/payment-intents/intent_xxx/escrow/milestones \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_test_your_key" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "milestoneIndex": 0,
    "amount": "50.00",
    "description": "Phase 1: Design"
  }'

# Complete milestone
curl https://api.finternet.com/v1/payment-intents/intent_xxx/escrow/milestones/milestone_xxx/complete \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_test_your_key" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "completedBy": "0x...",
    "completionProof": "proof_hash"
  }'
```

### Flow

```
1. Create payment intent (DvP type)
2. Payer signs and executes transaction
3. Transaction confirmed → Funds locked in escrow
4. Order status: Created (0)
